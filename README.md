### What it does
Cookie Monster is a Chrome browsing extension I developed with the intention of thwarting cookie based tracking when browsing online. It allows you to set rules that determine when cookies are allowed to be set on your browsing session, or alternatively modify cookies that meet specific criteria to further anonymize your online presence and "poison the well" making advertising re-targeting of your online identity impractical and unprofitable. The base concept is simple, if cookies set by 3rd parties attempting to track you are either swapped with randomized values or even the data from other users, 3rd party advertising companies are no longer able to accurately identify you as a unique user and cannot successfully track or advertise to your identity. The extension can either "poison" cookies matching (blacklist) or not matching (whitelist) domains that you specifiy by randomizing their values as they are set or alternatively the extension can "swap" cookies (non session based cookies only as to not facilitate session hijacking) with other users to mix your unique online identity with other users, invalidating any attempts to re-target you as a consumer. The poison functionality of the extension is completed, but the swapping functionality is still under development, as is the ability to aggregate stats on tracking domains and the extent to which cookies your browser receives have been modified by the extension.
